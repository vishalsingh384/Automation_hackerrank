# Automation_hackerrank

Using Puppeteer.JS and the concept of Promises, the project automates the steps done manually in the HackerRank website to code. With the help of Puppeteer.js the code|  logs in->goes to the problem solving page->goes to the question page one by one(int this case, the first 5)->write the code->run it and submit it. All this is done automatically without laying a finger.
